## React Fundamental Concepts Used
1. **React Components**: Functional components are used to structure the UI, promoting modularity and reusability.
2. **React State**: Manages component-specific data, especially in interactive sections like the shopping cart and wishlist.
3. **Context API**: Provides centralized state management, enabling data to be shared across multiple components without prop drilling.
4. **React Router**: Enables smooth navigation between pages, giving a single-page application feel.
5. **Event Handling**: Manages user interactions effectively across different components.

## Data Handling and Management
For data management, the project uses:
- **React Context API**: Centralizes global state, making it easier to manage actions like adding/removing items in the cart, handling the wishlist, and dynamically updating the website title.
- **Props Drilling**: Used for passing data between certain components on specific pages when a more localized approach is beneficial.

## Key Features
1. **Product Catalog**: A dynamic, searchable catalog of gadgets with real-time filtering options for a better user experience.
2. **Shopping Cart**: Allows users to add, view, and manage items for checkout.
3. **Wishlist**: Enables users to save favorite products for future purchase.
4. **Responsive Design**: Optimized for both desktop and mobile devices, providing a consistent user experience across screen sizes.
